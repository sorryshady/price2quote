# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Authentication system implementation
- UI/UX improvements and fixes
- Session management and persistence

## Recent Changes

1. Authentication System:

   - Implemented complete login flow with session management
   - Added session persistence using cookies and database
   - Created auth provider for client-side state management
   - Implemented secure logout functionality
   - Added middleware for route protection

2. Session Management:

   - Database-backed sessions with expiration
   - Secure cookie handling (httpOnly, sameSite)
   - Session validation and automatic checks
   - IP and user agent tracking for security

3. UI/UX Improvements:

   - Fixed navbar animation system using window scroll events
   - Improved mobile responsiveness
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Implemented toast notifications for user feedback

4. Security Enhancements:
   - Password hashing with bcrypt and pepper
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting preparation
   - Secure session handling

## Active Decisions

1. Using database-backed sessions instead of JWT
2. Implementing periodic auth checks (every 5 minutes)
3. Using window scroll events for reliable animations
4. Maintaining sticky positioning for navbar
5. Using Zustand for auth state management
6. Implementing provider-agnostic email system

## Current Considerations

1. Session security and management
2. Performance optimization for auth checks
3. Mobile responsiveness and animations
4. Error handling and user feedback
5. Security best practices implementation

## Next Steps

1. Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement OAuth providers
4. Add session analytics and monitoring
5. Optimize auth check intervals
6. Add comprehensive testing

## Known Issues

- None currently - recent changes have improved system stability

## Recent Insights

1. Window scroll events provide more reliable animation triggers
2. Database sessions offer better security and control
3. Regular auth checks improve session reliability
4. Provider pattern simplifies auth state management
5. Secure cookie handling is crucial for session security

## Active Questions

1. Password hashing algorithm selection (bcrypt/argon2)
2. JWT vs DB session management
3. OAuth provider library choice (next-auth vs custom)

## Current State

Registration and email verification are fully functional and visually polished. The system is ready for login, session, and OAuth work.
