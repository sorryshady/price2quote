# Active Context

## Current Focus: MVP Ready â†’ Enhanced Quote Management

**STATUS: MVP COMPLETE âœ…** - All core features implemented and functional. Ready for Phase 1 enhancements.

### COMPLETED FOUNDATION:

- **User Management**: Authentication, company onboarding, profile management
- **Quote Creation**: AI-assisted pricing, service selection, PDF generation
- **Email Integration**: Gmail OAuth, conversation tracking, PDF attachments
- **Analytics**: Revenue tracking, quote performance, subscription management
- **Subscription System**: Free/Pro tiers with usage limits and enforcement

### CURRENT PRIORITY: Enhanced Quote Status System ðŸŽ¯

**Problem Identified**: Current status system (`draft`, `sent`, `revised`, `accepted`, `rejected`) lacks clarity and doesn't support future payment integration.

**Solution Designed**: Refined status flow for better quote-to-cash lifecycle tracking:

```typescript
'draft' â†’ 'sent' â†’ 'under_revision' â†’ 'revised' â†’ 'accepted' â†’ 'project_started' â†’ 'completed' â†’ 'paid'
```

**Implementation Plan**:

- [ ] Database migration for new status values
- [ ] Update TypeScript types and validation schemas
- [ ] Refresh all UI components (status displays, filters, badges)
- [ ] Enhance analytics to track new conversion funnel
- [ ] Add status transition validation logic

### NEXT: Smart Payment Integration Architecture ðŸ’°

**Key Features Planned**:

1. **Universal Payment Schemes** - Default structures per company
2. **Quote-Specific Overrides** - Customize when needed
3. **AI-Suggested Structures** - Optimal payment plans based on complexity

  - **Solution**: The UI now checks for a real, valid Gmail OAuth connection (from the gmail_connections table) and only shows 'connected' if such a connection exists and is not expired. The presence of a company email alone no longer triggers a 'connected' status. Backend and UI logic updated accordingly.
  - **Benefits**: Prevents false positives, ensures users only see 'connected' when a real Gmail connection exists, improves reliability and user trust.
