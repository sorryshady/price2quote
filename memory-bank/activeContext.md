- **Graceful fallbacks for external API dependencies**

### Testing Strategy:

- Build validation before deployment
- Manual testing of critical user flows
- **Company selection persistence testing**
- **Currency conversion accuracy validation**
- **Exchange rate fallback scenarios**
- Error scenario validation

### New Environment Variables:
