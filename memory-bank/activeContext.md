# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Authentication system implementation
- UI/UX improvements and fixes
- Session management and persistence
- OAuth Authentication Implementation (Google and GitHub)
- User Authentication Flow

## Recent Changes

1. Authentication System:

   - Implemented complete login flow with session management
   - Added session persistence using cookies and database
   - Created auth provider for client-side state management
   - Implemented secure logout functionality
   - Added middleware for route protection

2. Session Management:

   - Database-backed sessions with expiration
   - Secure cookie handling (httpOnly, sameSite)
   - Session validation and automatic checks
   - IP and user agent tracking for security

3. UI/UX Improvements:

   - Fixed navbar animation system using window scroll events
   - Improved mobile responsiveness
   - Added loading states and error handling
   - Implemented toast notifications for user feedback

4. Security Enhancements:

   - Password hashing with bcrypt and pepper
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting preparation
   - Secure session handling

5. OAuth Authentication Implementation:

   - Implemented OAuth authentication with both Google and GitHub
   - Added provider-specific routes and callbacks
   - Implemented secure state parameter handling
   - Added provider conflict prevention
   - Implemented error handling with user-friendly redirects

6. OAuth Implementation Details:

   - Google OAuth:
     - Uses refresh tokens for future API access
     - Implements `prompt: 'select_account'` for better UX
     - Stores both access and refresh tokens
     - Handles token expiration
   - GitHub OAuth:
     - Uses non-expiring access tokens
     - Simpler implementation (no refresh tokens)
     - Direct login after first authentication

7. Security Features:

   - State parameter validation
   - Provider conflict prevention
   - Secure cookie handling
   - Error handling with redirects
   - Session management

## Active Decisions

1. Using database-backed sessions instead of JWT
2. Implementing periodic auth checks (every 5 minutes)
3. Using window scroll events for reliable animations
4. Maintaining sticky positioning for navbar
5. Using Zustand for auth state management
6. Implementing provider-agnostic email system
7. Keeping refresh token functionality for Google OAuth for future API integration
8. Using redirect-based error handling for better UX
9. Preventing multiple provider accounts with the same email
10. Using `prompt: 'select_account'` for Google OAuth to improve user experience

## Current Considerations

1. Session security and management
2. Performance optimization for auth checks
3. Mobile responsiveness and animations
4. Error handling and user feedback
5. Security best practices implementation
6. Future Google API integration possibilities
7. OAuth provider selection strategy
8. Session management optimization
9. Error handling improvements

## Next Steps

1. Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement OAuth providers
4. Add session analytics and monitoring
5. Optimize auth check intervals
6. Add comprehensive testing
7. Consider implementing refresh token flow for Google API access
8. Add more OAuth providers if needed
9. Implement token refresh mechanism for Google API calls
10. Add rate limiting for OAuth attempts

## Known Issues

- None currently - recent changes have improved system stability

## Recent Insights

1. Window scroll events provide more reliable animation triggers
2. Database sessions offer better security and control
3. Regular auth checks improve session reliability
4. Provider pattern simplifies auth state management
5. Secure cookie handling is crucial for session security

## Active Questions

1. Password hashing algorithm selection (bcrypt/argon2)
2. JWT vs DB session management
3. OAuth provider library choice (next-auth vs custom)

## Current State

Registration and email verification are fully functional and visually polished. The system is ready for login, session, and OAuth work.
