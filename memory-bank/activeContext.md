# Active Context

## Current Focus: Subscription Billing System Refinements COMPLETED ✅

**STATUS: SUBSCRIPTION BILLING SYSTEM FULLY OPTIMIZED** - All payment processing, cancellation flows, and billing display logic now working correctly.

### COMPLETED BILLING SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS:

**Problem Resolved**: Webhook payment processing failures, incorrect billing displays, and immediate subscription downgrades on cancellation.

**Solution Implemented**: Complete overhaul of payment tracking, subscription management, and billing UI.

### RECENT MAJOR UPDATES:

10. **NEW: Subscription Billing System Optimization COMPLETED:**

    - **Payment History System**: Replaced invoices table with payments table for accurate payment tracking
      - Records payment_id, amount, currency, status, payment_method, paid_at date
      - Links to user and subscription for proper relationship tracking
      - Handles both subscription and one-time payments
    - **Webhook Handler Redesign**: Fixed Dodo Payments webhook processing
      - Resolved UUID conflicts by using user_id instead of subscription_id for payments
      - Proper handling of payment.succeeded events with real payment data
      - Background subscription tier updates when payments succeed
      - Error handling for missing user data
    - **Smart Cancellation Flow**: Pro access retained until billing period ends
      - Cancellation marks subscription as 'cancelled' but keeps user on pro tier
      - Automatic expiry checking downgrades users when period actually ends
      - Background subscription monitoring in auth endpoint
      - Clear messaging about access retention until period end
    - **Enhanced Billing Page Display Logic**:
      - Free tier: Shows only status ("Free Plan")
      - Active subscription: Shows next billing date and current period
      - Cancelled subscription: Shows access expiry date (no next billing)
      - Payment history with method, date/time, and subscription context
    - **Auth State Refresh**: Immediate UI updates after subscription changes
      - Cancel button refreshes auth state and page data
      - Real-time subscription status updates
      - Proper badge updates in navigation
    - **Database Schema Cleanup**: Removed unused invoices table and updated exports
      - Generated migration to drop invoices table
      - Updated all imports to use payments schema
      - Clean schema organization
    - **Automatic Renewal Handling**: Understanding of Dodo Payments renewal flow
      - Dodo automatically charges saved payment methods at billing cycle end
      - Webhook events sent for successful/failed renewals
      - Current implementation properly handles renewal success events
      - Payment records created for all transactions
    - **Benefits**: Professional subscription management with proper timing, accurate payment tracking, and clear user communication

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization:

- Server actions in `src/app/server-actions/`
- Database schema in `src/db/schema/`
- Utility functions in `src/lib/`
- UI components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Payment logic in `src/lib/dodo-payments.ts`**

### Best Practices:

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states for all async operations
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- **Background subscription monitoring**

### Testing Strategy:

- Build validation before deployment
- Manual testing of critical user flows
- **Webhook testing with Dodo Payments**
- Error scenario validation
