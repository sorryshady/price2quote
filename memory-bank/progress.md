## Next Development Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Quote Management (CURRENT PRIORITY)

#### Enhanced Quote Status System 🎯

**Timeline**: Week 1-2

'draft' → 'sent' → 'under_revision' → 'revised' → 'accepted' → 'project_started' → 'completed' → 'paid'
```

**Implementation Tasks**:

- [ ] Database migration for new status values
- [ ] Update TypeScript types and validation schemas
- [ ] Refresh all UI components (status displays, filters, badges)
- [ ] Enhance analytics to track new conversion funnel
- [ ] Add status transition validation logic

**Benefits**:

- Clear workflow progression
- Better analytics and conversion tracking
- Foundation for payment integration
- Eliminates confusion around revision states
