## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Google OAuth Configuration (Required for Gmail integration)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here.googleusercontent.com

# Gemini AI Configuration
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Dodo Payments Configuration (Required for Pro subscriptions)
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=your_dodo_payments_api_key_here
DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_ID=your_dodo_payments_product_id_here
```

### 2. Dodo Payments Setup (Required for Pro Subscriptions)

To enable Pro subscription upgrades, you need to set up Dodo Payments:

#### Step 1: Create a Dodo Payments Account
1. Go to [Dodo Payments](https://dodopayments.com/) and create an account
2. Complete the account verification process

#### Step 2: Get API Credentials
1. Go to the [Dodo Payments Dashboard](https://dashboard.dodopayments.com/)
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Copy your API keys:
   - **Test Mode**: Use `sk_test_your_test_key` for development
   - **Live Mode**: Use `sk_live_your_live_key` for production

#### Step 3: Create a Product
1. In your Dodo Payments dashboard, create a new product for your "Pro" subscription
2. Set the pricing (e.g., $29/month or $290/year)
3. Configure the product settings (recurring billing, trial periods, etc.)
4. Copy the Product ID

#### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
Add the following to your `.env` file:
```env
# For development (Test Mode)
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=sk_test_your_test_key
DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_ID=your_product_id_here

# For production (Live Mode)
DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY=sk_live_your_live_key
DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_ID=your_product_id_here
```

#### Step 5: Configure Supabase Edge Function Secrets
**CRITICAL**: You must set these environment variables as secrets in your Supabase project:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to "Edge Functions"
3. Find the "create-subscription" function
4. Go to "Settings" or "Environment Variables"
5. Add the following secrets:
   - `DODO_PAYMENTS_API_KEY`: Your Dodo Payments API key (test or live)
   - `DODO_PAYMENTS_PRODUCT_ID`: Your Pro subscription product ID

**Important Notes**:
- Use **test keys** (`sk_test_...`) for development and testing
- Use **live keys** (`sk_live_...`) for production
- The system automatically detects test vs live mode based on your API key prefix
- Edge Functions do not inherit variables from your local `.env` file - you must set them as secrets

#### Step 6: Test the Integration
1. Use test API keys during development
2. Try clicking "Upgrade to Pro" in the Profile section
3. You should be redirected to Dodo Payments checkout page
4. Use test payment methods provided by Dodo Payments
5. Check the browser console and Supabase Edge Function logs for any errors

### 3. Google OAuth Setup

2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
   - Search for "Gmail API" and enable it

#### Step 2: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - Choose **External** user type

     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`

   - Name: `PricingGPT`
   - Authorized JavaScript origins:
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
     - `https://your-domain.com` (for production)
   - Authorized redirect URIs:
     - `http://localhost:5173` (for development)
     - `https://your-domain.com` (for production)

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Copy the **Client ID** from the credentials page
2. Add it to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here.googleusercontent.com
   ```

### 4. Supabase Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migrations in the `supabase/migrations` folder

  - Uses `https://live.dodopayments.com` endpoint
  - Processes real payments
  - Only use in production
