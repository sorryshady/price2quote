BUGS:
quotes badge needs to be that of latest quote (it shows rejected when we making new revised quote in the conversations route).
toast is having issues when trying to check number of unread emails (i think it should only take count of unread incoming emails and not both outbound and incoming).
Revised quotes number not being updated. So cant enforce limit for revisions. When in the revision screen it shows 0/2 for the new quote when editing. What we want is overall revisions 2 not per quote 2 revisions.
Price is currently always coming in dollars. Have to sort out the conversion based on currency that company sets.
quote preview is also defaulting to $. Should reflect company currency.
Email when given in onboarding form should not be automatically connected to the google email sending thingy.
random quote_sent in status inside conversation.
when new unread email fetched invalidate conversation using the id.
everywhere currency is defaulting to dollars

Okay i just noticed something. The first time we create a quote when there are no other quotes. The quotes page, and the email page are not immediately refetching because if they did we would have the quotes showing up there immediately
