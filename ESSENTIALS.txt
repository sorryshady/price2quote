BUGS:
DONE: quotes badge needs to be that of latest quote (it shows rejected when we making new revised quote in the conversations route).
DONE: toast is having issues when trying to check number of unread emails (i think it should only take count of unread incoming emails and not both outbound and incoming).
DONE: Revised quotes number not being updated. So cant enforce limit for revisions. When in the revision screen it shows 0/2 for the new quote when editing. What we want is overall revisions 2 not per quote 2 revisions.
DONE: Price is currently always coming in dollars. Have to sort out the conversion based on currency that company sets.
quote preview is also defaulting to $. Should reflect company currency. everywhere currency is defaulting to dollars
DONE: Email when given in onboarding form should not be automatically connected to the google email sending thingy.
random quote_sent in status inside conversation.
DONE: when new unread email fetched invalidate conversation using the id.

Negotiation is giving results in USD. Need to fix that
Need to check the implementation of the actions required thing. Right now it shows some things but not fully functional.
Add companies settings page to add services, remove service and edit logo, name etc.

Dashboard and analytics persist on client side. Invalidate when something changes
Add better loading states actually.
Dashboard also has to show the currency conversion because it is also changing
