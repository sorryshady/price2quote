BUGS:
DONE: quotes badge needs to be that of latest quote (it shows rejected when we making new revised quote in the conversations route).
DONE: toast is having issues when trying to check number of unread emails (i think it should only take count of unread incoming emails and not both outbound and incoming).
DONE: Revised quotes number not being updated. So cant enforce limit for revisions. When in the revision screen it shows 0/2 for the new quote when editing. What we want is overall revisions 2 not per quote 2 revisions.
Price is currently always coming in dollars. Have to sort out the conversion based on currency that company sets.
quote preview is also defaulting to $. Should reflect company currency. everywhere currency is defaulting to dollars
Email when given in onboarding form should not be automatically connected to the google email sending thingy.
random quote_sent in status inside conversation.
when new unread email fetched invalidate conversation using the id.
