BUGS:
changing status inside conversation should invalidate tanstack cache for quotes in quotes page
view conversation needs to be connected
revision quote when service removed should show add service.
quotes badge needs to be that of latest quote (it shows rejected when we make new revised quote).
toast is having issues when trying.
Revised quotes number not being updated. So cant enforce limit for revisions. When in the revision screen it shows 0/2 for the new quote when editing. What we want is overall revisions 2 not per quote 2 revisions.
